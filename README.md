# Description
For this project I choose to focus on developing state machines for simple AI practice. I plan on making a basic city simulation where units follow routines based off of their current state.

## Yet Another Refactoring Overhaul Commit - 8/27/24
Due to a hanging bug in the transition from socializing to other states, I had to restart the project. This and future versions will now rely more on Unity's Component-Based Architecture.
